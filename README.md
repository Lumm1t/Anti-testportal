# Anti-testportal

Minimalistic Chrome extension - bypass for blur check and time limit on testportal.pl(net).

🈹🐀💥 Changing pages will not display a warning about leaving the page. After the time for answering the question (or completing the test) has elapsed, nothing will happen - you can still answer the questions!
