Minimalistic (very) Chrome extension - bypass for blur check and time limit on testportal.pl.

🈹🐀💥 Changing pages will not display a warning about leaving the page. After the time for answering the question (or completing the test) has elapsed, nothing will happen - you can still answer the questions!
